## Description

  

A simple inline calendar, date selection tool for [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram) telegram bots written in Python.

  

Offers two types of date pickers:

  

Navigation calendar - user can either select a date or move to the next or previous month/year by clicking a singe button.

  

Dialog calendar - user selects year on first stage, month on next stage, day on last stage.

  

  

**From version 0.2 supports aiogram 3, use version 0.1.1 with aiogram 2.**
**From version 0.6 supports aiogram 3.7, use version 0.5 with aiogram <3.7 **

  
## Main features
- Two calendars with abilities to navigate years, months, days altogether or in dialog
- Ability to set specified locale (language of captions) or inherit from user`s locale
- Limiting the range of dates to select from
- Highlighting todays date 
  

## Usage

  

Install package

  

  

pip install aiogram_calendar

  

  

A full working example on how to use aiogram-calendar is provided in `*bot_example.py*`.

  

  

In example keyboard with buttons is created.

  

Each button triggers a calendar in a different way by adding it to a message with a *reply_markup*.

  

reply_markup=await SimpleCalendar().start_calendar()

^^ will reply with a calendar created using English localization (months and days of week captions). Locale can be overridden by passing locale argument:

  

reply_markup=await SimpleCalendar(locale='uk_UA').start_calendar()

or by getting locale from User data provided by telegram API using get_user_locale method by passing `message.from_user` to it

  

reply_markup=await SimpleCalendar(locale=await get_user_locale(message.from_user)).start_calendar()

  

Depending on what button of calendar user will press callback is precessed using the *process_selection* method.

  

selected, date = await SimpleCalendar(locale=await get_user_locale(callback_query.from_user)).process_selection(callback_query, callback_data)

Here locale is specified from `callback_query.from_user`
